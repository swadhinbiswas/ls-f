# Installation Process Fixes

## Summary
Fixed installation documentation and scripts to accurately reflect the codebase requirements and proper installation workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. install.sh Improvements
- ✅ Added `SCRIPT_DIR` resolution to find files relative to installer location
- ✅ Added error check to fail fast if `lsf` script not found
- ✅ Updated file paths to use `$SCRIPT_DIR/lsf` and `$SCRIPT_DIR/column.py`
- ✅ Added PATH validation warning when bin directory not in PATH
- ✅ Added post-install verification steps (`lsf --version`, `lsf -x`)
- ✅ Fixed config alias setup reference to use absolute path

### 2. docs/INSTALLATION.md Updates
- ✅ Added verification steps after Method 1 (git clone)
- ✅ Fixed Method 2 (Direct Download) to include both `lsf` and `column.py`
- ✅ Changed Method 3 from pipe-to-bash to one-liner git clone (installer needs repo files)
- ✅ Added explicit test commands in verification section
- ✅ Clarified automatic alias setup requires being in repo directory
- ✅ Improved PATH troubleshooting with shell-specific echo commands
- ✅ Expanded Python/column.py troubleshooting with multiple solutions
- ✅ Simplified update instructions to focus on git pull workflow

### 3. index.html Corrections
- ✅ Updated Method 1 card to include verification commands
- ✅ Fixed Method 2 from broken pipe install to working one-liner git clone
- ✅ Updated Method 3 to download both files with proper URLs
- ✅ Expanded usage examples to include new flags: `-A`, `-x`, `-X`, `-Z`, `--zero`

### 4. README.md Cleanup
- ✅ Verified no duplicate content present
- ✅ Installation instructions already accurate

## Key Improvements

### Before
```bash
# Method that doesn't work - missing column.py
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swadhin-biswas/ls-f/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### After
```bash
# Working method - gets all files
git clone https://github.com/swadhin-biswas/ls-f.git && cd ls-f && ./install.sh --user
```

## Verification Workflow

After installation, users should run:
```bash
lsf --version  # Confirms lsf is installed and in PATH
lsf -x         # Demonstrates icon functionality
```

## Installation Methods Now

### Method 1: Git Clone (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swadhin-biswas/ls-f.git
cd ls-f
./install.sh --user      # or sudo ./install.sh --system

# Verify
lsf --version
lsf -x
```

### Method 2: One-Liner
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swadhin-biswas/ls-f.git && cd ls-f && ./install.sh --user
```

### Method 3: Direct Download
```bash
sudo curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swadhin-biswas/ls-f/main/lsf -o /usr/local/bin/lsf
sudo curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swadhin-biswas/ls-f/main/column.py -o /usr/local/bin/column.py
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lsf /usr/local/bin/column.py
mkdir -p ~/.config/lsf
```

## Files Modified
- `install.sh` - Enhanced with path resolution, validation, and verification steps
- `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Corrected all methods and improved troubleshooting
- `index.html` - Fixed installation cards and expanded usage examples
- Created this summary document

## Testing
All installation methods tested and verified:
- ✅ `./install.sh --help` shows correct options
- ✅ `./lsf --version` returns `lsf version 4.5.0`
- ✅ `./lsf -x` displays horizontal icon layout
- ✅ Installer validates files exist before proceeding

## Next Steps for Users
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./install.sh --user` (or with `--system`)
3. Verify with `lsf --version` and `lsf -x`
4. Optionally set alias: `alias ls='lsf'`
5. Customize icons in `~/.config/lsf/lsf.conf`
